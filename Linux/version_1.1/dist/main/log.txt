Chosen generation parameters:

Both 1,5- and 1,4-isomers are generated.
Products for internal alkynes are kept.
Molecules are filtered according to Lipinski rules: 
-None.
LogBB Clark will be calculated.
Molecules with logBB  less than -10.0 will be dropped.
An output file will be saved in .txt format.
