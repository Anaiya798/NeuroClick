# NeuroClick
Software for *in silico* click reaction synthesis and prediction of drug-like molecules permeating the blood-brain barrier.  
Last update: 28.09.2022  
Version 1.1: an old release, was up-to-date when our team sent an article to Journal of Cheminformatics, August 2022.  
Version 1.2 (recommended): a new release where the key feature is multithreading, so the app can be running in the background mode.
